"""Celery contract: every scheduled task must be registered with the worker.

A beat schedule entry whose task module is missing from ``include`` is
silently discarded by the worker ("Received unregistered task") and the
housekeeping it performs never runs. This test pins every scheduled task
name to the registry the worker builds after importing the include list.
